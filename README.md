# âœ¨ Vanilla JS To-Do List Widget

A feature-rich, interactive to-do list application built from the ground up with pure ("vanilla") JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project was undertaken as a foundational exercise to master core web development concepts without the use of any frameworks or libraries.

## ðŸš€ Features

This application isn't just a simple list; it's a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) component with a modern user interface.

*   **âœ… Add New Tasks:** A clean input field to add new items to the list.
*   **âœ… Delete Tasks:** Each task has a dedicated delete button to remove it.
*   **âœ… Edit Tasks In-Place:** Click "Edit" to transform the task text into an input field, then "Save" to commit the changes.
*   **âœ… Mark as Complete:** Simply click on a task's text to toggle a "completed" state, visually marked with a line-through.
*   **âœ… Responsive Design:** The layout is built with Flexbox to adapt cleanly to different screen sizes.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Concepts Demonstrated

This project exclusively uses the three core languages of the web to demonstrate a solid understanding of the fundamentals.

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure with elements like `<main>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `<button>`.
*   **CSS3:** Modern styling techniques, including:
    *   **Flexbox** for robust and responsive layout management.
    *   **`box-sizing: border-box`** for intuitive and predictable element sizing.
    *   **CSS Classes** for dynamic state management (e.g., the `.completed` class).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** All logic is handled with pure, framework-free JavaScript.

### Key JavaScript Concepts Implemented:

*   **DOM Manipulation:**
    *   Creating elements from scratch (`document.createElement`).
    *   Adding elements to the page (`appendChild`, `prepend`).
    *   Replacing elements f
